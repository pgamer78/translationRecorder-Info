If you have source audio that you need to load on your tablet, it muxt be in the exact format as the project.
It must be:

  * for the same Bible book
  * the same translation type (REG, UDB, or ULB)
  * recorded in the same mode (either verse or chunk mode)
  
The source audio should be a file with the extension .tr.

When the source audio is created in translationRecorder, it can be saved anywhere on the device. 
When loading source audio into translationRecorder, the file picker opens to the TranslationRecorder directory of the internal
storage, so if the source audio file has been downloaded there, it is easy to find. However, the file picker enables you to 
navigate to any other directory on your device to load source audio from any location.
